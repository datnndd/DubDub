"""Control-plane gRPC service.

Translates the wire into scheduler calls and back. The rules it enforces here
are the ones that must hold at the *boundary*, before anything reaches the
domain:

  * authentication — an enrollment token once, then proof of key possession
  * fencing — one active session per worker, newest epoch wins, stale epochs
    dropped rather than merged
  * ordering — persist a result before acknowledging it
  * integrity — an artifact is verified against its declared digest before it
    is renamed into place, and only an explicit last chunk commits one

Everything else is delegated. If this file starts making scheduling decisions,
something has been put in the wrong place.

The control stream runs as two independent loops rather than a single
request/response generator. That is not stylistic: a worker uploading its
status while the server is trying to push an assignment would otherwise
deadlock behind its own reader, and the heartbeats that prove the worker is
alive are exactly what must never queue behind anything else.
