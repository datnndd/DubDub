"""The node's inbound listener: a gRPC server hosting NodeService.

Off by default. Enabling it is the consent surface — there is no per-job
approval prompt, because a prompt per job makes a shared GPU unusable and
trains people to click yes. What replaces it is visibility: every attach,
refusal and disconnect is in the connection log, and any session can be kicked.

Binds to 127.0.0.1 unless the user separately and explicitly widens it. That
default is nearly useless on its own, which is the point: reaching a node from
another machine should be a decision someone made, not a side effect of turning
on a feature.
